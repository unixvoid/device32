# Lava Lamp

This is a lava lamp simulation using metaballs as blobs.

## Requirements
- device32 hardware (ESP32-based with OLED display)
- PlatformIO development environment
- USB connection for flashing

## Setup
1. Open this folder (`examples/lava_lamp/`) in VSCode with PlatformIO installed.
2. Connect your device32 via USB.
3. Use PlatformIO to build and flash the project.

## Usage
The simulation displays animated metaballs resembling a lava lamp on the OLED screen.

## Controls
- No user controls; the animation is fully automated.

## Notes
- Uses metaball rendering for smooth, organic shapes.
