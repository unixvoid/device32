# Morph

This is a zero-gravity-esque lava lamp simulation. I was going for the OG Xbox boot-up screen feel.

## Requirements
- device32 hardware (ESP32-based with OLED display)
- PlatformIO development environment
- USB connection for flashing

## Setup
1. Open this folder (`examples/morph/`) in VSCode with PlatformIO installed.
2. Connect your device32 via USB.
3. Use PlatformIO to build and flash the project.

## Usage
The simulation displays an animated morphing blob on the OLED screen.

## Controls
- No user controls; the animation is fully automated.
