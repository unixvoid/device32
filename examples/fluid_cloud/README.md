# Fluid Cloud

Fluid Cloud is a WIP fluid simulation demo, it started as a lava lamp but I ended up going a different direction. I plan to re-visit this eventually and make the fluid more active and move around.

## Requirements
- device32 hardware (ESP32-based with OLED display)
- PlatformIO development environment
- USB connection for flashing

## Setup
1. Open this folder (`examples/fluid_cloud/`) in VSCode with PlatformIO installed.
2. Connect your device32 via USB.
3. Use PlatformIO to build and flash the project.

## Usage
The simulation displays a fluid-like animation on the OLED screen, resembling moving particles or clouds.

## Controls
- No user controls; the animation is fully automated.

## Notes
- This is a work-in-progress; future updates may add more interactivity or fluid dynamics.
