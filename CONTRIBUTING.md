# Contributing

Thank you for contributing!

Guidelines:
- Keep examples self-contained.
- Add a short README for each example explaining:
  - Required libraries, board config, expected behavior, wiring, and any assets.
- Prefer minimal, well-documented examples readers can expand.
- If adding libraries, prefer using library.json (PlatformIO) or include a link to Arduino Library Manager / GitHub repo.
- Add unit or CI checks where feasible to ensure examples build.

PR checklist:
- [ ] Example builds in target environment (Arduino / PlatformIO / IDF).
- [ ] README updated with usage instructions.
- [ ] Any required binary assets included under example/assets/ or a link is provided.
